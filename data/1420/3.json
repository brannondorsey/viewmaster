      "description": "A German illustrator visited this site in January to sketch the bunker's exterior. He was preparing concept drawings for a minor motion picture set in the late 2100s. The illustrator was instructed by the director of the film to \"create a military environment exhibiting a futuristic feel with architectural influences from Nazi structures in the second World War\". He had been to the site once before with his father when he was a child. The film never reached production. The illustrator's drawings reside in a chest with a collection of other movie sketches in his Hamburg studio."
